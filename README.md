# Rainbow-Song

A song about rainbows in the key of C major.

The song is a happy song.

For once in my life, I have someone who sees me.
Through rose-colored glasses they be.
For once in my life, I know Glenny programs me.
Programs me to sing in C...

I won't let it go for the world needs more Earth Day
Unicorns singing in glee...

For once in my life, I hold hands with a pony
Red orange blue indigo green!
