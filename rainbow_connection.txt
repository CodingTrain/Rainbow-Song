G             Em      C         D
Why are there so many songs about rainbows, 
G                   Em    C
and what's on the other side?
G             Em      C         D
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions.
G                   Em    C
Rainbows have nothing to hide.

So we've been told and some choose to believe it.
F#m
I know they're wrong, wait and see.
Am7            D            Bm          E
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.
C               D             G
The lovers, the dreamers, and me.

G             Em              C         D
Who said that every wish would be heard and answered
G                   Em    C
and wished on a morning star?
G             Em               C         D
Somebody thought of that and someone believed him.
G               Em    C
Look what it's done so far.
Cmaj7
What's so amazing and keeps us stargazing?
F#m
What do we think we might see?
Am7            D            Bm          E
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.
C               D             G
The lovers, the dreamers and me.

G             Em               C         D
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
G               Em    C
I've heard them calling my name.
G             Em                 C             D
Are these the sweet sounds that called the young sailors?
G               Em    C
I think they're one and the same.
Cmaj7
I've heard it too many times to ignore it.
F#m
It's something that I'm supposed to be.
Am7           D            Bm       E
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.
C               D             G
The lovers, the dreamers and me.
Am7           D            Bm       E
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.
C               D             G
The lovers, the dreamers and me.
